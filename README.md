# Pong in C++

This is a recreation of the classic game Pong in C++, using ![RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/).

It's part of a series of projects I have been working on aiming to re-create classic games in C++. Last year I did a re-creation of ![Space Invaders](https://github.com/cxtraa/space_invaders_clone_cs50), and I'm continuing this series with Pong and ![Snake](https://github.com/cxtraa?tab=repositories).
